        <strong>2/2/24 - And we're back...</strong>
        <p>
            Some time ago I forgot to renew my domain and even though I wasn't doing anything with it, I had it for so long that I felt something was missing.  Turns out after the domain squatter bought it, they didn't have any plans for it either and let it expire, so now it's back in my hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have no idea what I want to do yet, but I figure I'll make use of it somehow.  While I work out a design, blogging platform and general idea for shit, I'll have this placeholder here.
